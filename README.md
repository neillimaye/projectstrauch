I heavily comment the code from various tutorials as I progress through them. Thought it would be a helpful resource.

It's named strauch for one reasons:
1) My friend with the last name Strauch keeps insanely good notes for our college classes and lets others see them.

I was inspired to do this after having a lot of trouble learning new frameworks. I realized that writing all the necessary notes to understand the code as written helped me a lot and made it a great resource for reference.

Also learning about what John Lions did with the UNIX Kernel was a big part of my inspiration to do this project.
