I heavily comment the code from various tutorials as I progress through them. Thought it would be a helpful resource.

It's named saitama-strauch for two reasons:
1) I try to imagine how Saitama from One Punch Man would explain the code
2) My friend with the last name Strauch keeps insanely good notes for our college classes and lets others reference them.

I was inspired to do this after having a lot of trouble learning new frameworks. I realized that writing all the necessary notes to understand the code as written helped me a lot and made it a great resource for reference.
