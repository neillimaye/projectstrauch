I heavily comment the code from various tutorials as I progress through them. Thought it would be a helpful resource.

It's named saitama-strauch for two reasons:
1) I try to imagine how Saitama from One Punch Man would explain the code
2) My friend with the last name Strauch keeps insanely good notes for our college classes and lets others reference them.
