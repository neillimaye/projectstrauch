/*class Square extends React.Component {

  This whole block of code was the original way of defining a "Square", in a manner
  similar to object-oriented programming.
  Later on, the 'Square' object had all of its modifying functionality inherited from the Board class, making it a *controlled component*
  Below this is code that defines square as a *functional component*
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      value: null,
    };
  }
  This constructor was made for the squares to track information, not the board
  in the end, the Board was designed to track information


  render() {
    return (
      <button
        className="square"
        onClick={() => this.props.onClick()}
      >
        {this.props.value}
      </button>
      the 'onClick' line is written as such to pass a function as an object. the => makes sure the right *this* is called
    );
  }
}

/*
Functional components are a simpler way of coding parts of a program
All they do is have a 'render' method and don't have their own data
The function just takes props (a 'properties' object that's kind of like metadata for
a class) and is told what to output
